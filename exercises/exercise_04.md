# Exercise 04

## Statement -
  Write a test for the following controller routes:
    1. `/workshop/exchange_rate/<string:currency>`
       - This endpoint returns the exchange rate of a currency against USD.
       - Test it to verify that it's logic is working correctly when we pass a
         valid currency code(s)
         (e.g. /workshop/exchange_rate/INR).
