# Exercise 03

## Statement -
  Write a test for the following controller routes:
    1. `/workshop/jsonrpc/hello`
       - This endpoint returns a greeting message.
       - Test it to verify that if you pass a custom name, the response greeting
         includes that name.
    2. `/workshop/last-partner-name`
       - This endpoint returns the name of last created partner.
       - Test it to verify if it works correctly.
